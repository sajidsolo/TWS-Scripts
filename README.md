# +1 time every second ‚è∞
This script is the **MAIN** script for the game which gives the player +1 second on the leaderstats 








Can be Found in Releases 

# Leaderstats 
This Lua script is required and without it the main script will not work. So think its more of a *API* or a *Core* which allow the main script to work.
The leaderstats script adds a leaderboard and also a data store service which saves players time spent on the game.
